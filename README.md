# Spotify-Instrumental-Skipper

This tool was developed by ReDiGermany.
I (ReDi) was annoyed by rap music artists uploading bunch of instrumentals and live versions of songs.
So i developped this. Not the best, not the most fancy stuff. But it does what i need.
Use it, extend it, do whatever u want to with it.
